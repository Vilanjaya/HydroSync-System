# HydroSync System
Designing a water level controlling system using a PIC16F877A micro-controller involves interfacing sensors to detect water levels, programming the micro-controller, and implementing control logic. In this example, I'll outline a basic system using interrupts to monitor water levels and control a pump to maintain a desired level. Please note that this is a simplified example, and actual implementations may vary based on specific requirements and hardware.

**Components Needed:**

1.  PIC16F877A micro-controller
2.  Water level sensors (float switches, ultrasonic sensors, etc.)
3.  Relay module to control the pump
4.  Pump
5.  Power supply
6.  Connecting wires
7.  Breadboard (if using)

**Connections:**

1.  Connect water level sensors to specific ports on the PIC16F877A.
2.  Connect the relay module to the PIC16F877A to control the pump.
3.  Connect the pump to the relay module.

**Code Example (using PIC assembly language):**

    ; Define constants
    SENSOR_PORT     equ PORTA   ; Port where water level sensors are connected
    PUMP_CONTROL    equ PORTB   ; Port where the relay for pump control is connected
    
    ; Define variables
    waterLevel      equ 0xFF    ; Variable to store water level status
    
    ; Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) for external interrupt 0
    ORG 0x04
    GOTO ISR_INT0
    
    ; Main program
    ORG 0x00
    START:
        ; Initialize
        BSF STATUS, RP0 ; Bank 1
        CLRF TRISA      ; Set all PORTA pins as inputs for water level sensors
        CLRF TRISB      ; Set all PORTB pins as outputs for pump control
        BCF STATUS, RP0 ; Bank 0
        
        ; Configure external interrupt 0
        BSF INTCON, INT0IE  ; Enable external interrupt 0
        BCF INTCON, INT0IF  ; Clear interrupt flag
        
        ; Main loop
    MAIN_LOOP:
        ; Implement control logic based on water level status
        MOVF waterLevel, W
        ANDLW 0x03          ; Mask lower two bits (assuming 4 possible water levels)
        
        ; Custom logic based on water level status
        ; You may need to adjust this based on your specific requirements
        
        ; Example: If water level is 00, turn off the pump
        BTFSS STATUS, Z      ; Check if water level is 00
        BSF PORTB, 0        ; Set RB0 to turn on the pump
        BCF PORTB, 0        ; Clear RB0 to turn off the pump
        
        ; Other logic for different water levels can be added
        
        ; End of main loop
        GOTO MAIN_LOOP
    
    ; External Interrupt 0 Service Routine
    ISR_INT0:
        ; Read the status of water level sensors and update the waterLevel variable
        MOVF SENSOR_PORT, W
        MOVWF waterLevel
    
        ; Additional debounce logic or filtering can be added here if needed
    
        ; Clear interrupt flag
        BCF INTCON, INT0IF
    
        ; Return from ISR
        RETFIE
**Explanation:**

-   The program sets up the micro-controller to monitor the water level using external interrupts.
-   The main loop checks the water level status and controls the pump based on the desired logic.
-   The external interrupt service routine (ISR) updates the water level variable when a change in water level is detected.

This is a basic example, and you may need to adapt the code based on your specific sensor type, desired control logic, and any additional features you want to implement. Additionally, you should consider adding error handling, denouncing, and calibration based on the characteristics of your sensors. Always refer to the PIC16F877A datasheet and reference materials for accurate information.
